This repository documents the process of updating a website I originally built a year ago, using insights and techniques from the [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia) YouTube tutorial on creating a modern portfolio website. I am still working on updating it.

## Objective  
The goal of this update was to refresh the design, improve responsiveness, and implement modern best practices for a more polished and professional look.

1. **Modernized the Layout**  
   - Redesigned sections to create a clean and minimalistic layout inspired by the tutorial.

2. **Updated Styling with CSS**  
   - Implemented a consistent color palette and font hierarchy.
   - Utilized flexbox and CSS grid for improved responsiveness.
   - Added animations for smooth transitions and hover effects.

3. **Optimized for Mobile Devices (In progress)**   
   - Added media queries to ensure a seamless user experience across all screen sizes.
   - Improved navigation for smaller screens with a collapsible menu.

4. **Integrated Modern Features**

   - Included a call-to-action button with a polished hover effect.  
   - Enhanced accessibility with proper semantic tags and alt attributes.

## Technologies Used

- **CSS3**: For styling and responsive design.  
- **JavaScript**: To implement interactivity (e.g., toggling the navigation bar).

## Steps Followed  
1. Watched the tutorial to understand the design principles and best practices.  
2. Cloned my existing website's repository as a backup.  
3. Updated the HTML structure and rewrote the CSS to align with the tutorial's design.  
4. Tested the website locally to ensure functionality and responsiveness.  
5. Deployed the updated version to my hosting platform.

## Lessons Learned  
- Leveraging flexbox and CSS grid makes responsive design more intuitive.  
- Animations enhance user experience when applied subtly.  
- Regular updates keep a project relevant and aligned with industry standards.
